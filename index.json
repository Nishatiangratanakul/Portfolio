        "description": "Kowloon is a dual-layered  book that contrasts the historical reality of the Kowloon Walled City with its fictionalized portrayals in popular media. Once a self-regulated enclave shaped by geopolitical tensions, the city has become a cyberpunk icon, often depicted as a chaotic, futuristic labyrinth.Designed as two books within one, the piece features perforated pages that readers can tear open, revealing the hidden \"fiction\" layer beneath the \"reality\" section.  The \"reality\" section takes an academic, text-based approach, while the \"fiction\" layer is more image-driven, reflecting how history transforms into myth.",

The book unfolds in four parts: a layered flyer that introduces the cone as an object, a translucent paper booklet mapping my movement between each cone, an index cataloging my reflections at each site, and a fold-out sheet showing how, over time, the cones lost their objectivity and became simply the color orange. Bound in an orange file folder with office supply-inspired binding, the book evokes construction and urban spaces' bureaucratic and municipal nature.",
